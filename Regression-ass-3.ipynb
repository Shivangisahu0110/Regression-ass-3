    "Ridge Regression \n",
    "Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression\n",
    "OLS regression aims to find the best-fitting line through the data points by minimizing the sum of the squared differences (residuals) between the observed values and the values predicted by the linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS: Does not include any regularization. It purely minimizes the residual sum of squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Includes an L2 penalty term, which discourages large coefficients and hence helps to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bias-Variance Tradeoff:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS: Can have high variance if there is multicollinearity (high correlation between predictors) or if the model is too complex relative to the amount of data, leading to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Introduces some bias into the model by shrinking the coefficients, but this can significantly reduce variance, leading to better generalization on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS: Sensitive to multicollinearity, as it can lead to large, unstable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: More robust to multicollinearity because the regularization term stabilizes the coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Solution Uniqueness:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS: The solution may not be unique if there is perfect multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: The regularization term ensures that the solution is unique even in the presence of multicollinearity."
